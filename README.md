# Travel-blog website

I designed and built a user-friendly website for travelers that showcases the top 10 places to visit in top 10 cities.

The website allows users to search for their destination and easily find the most popular tourist attractions in the area and also to book an activity in connection with the place.

To further enhance the user experience, I incorporated various animations to keep users engaged and on the website for longer periods of time.

The website also has useful articles about how to travel easy ans safe.
