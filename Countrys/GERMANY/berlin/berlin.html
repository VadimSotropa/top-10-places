            The Brandenburg Gate is one of the most iconic landmarks in Germany
            and a symbol of Berlin. It was built in the late 18th century and is
            located at the end of the famous Unter den Linden boulevard. The
            gate is a popular tourist attraction and has been featured in many
            films and TV shows. But did you know that it has some interesting
            facts that you might not have heard before?
          </p>
          <br />
          <ul>
            <li>
              The Brandenburg Gate was originally built as a symbol of peace
              between Prussia and France.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              The gate has been damaged several times throughout its history,
              including during World War II.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              The Brandenburg Gate is also home to the famous Quadriga
              sculpture, which depicts the goddess of victory riding a chariot
              pulled by four horses.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              The gate has become an important symbol of German reunification
              since 1989.
            </li>

            The Reichstag Building is a historical edifice in Berlin, Germany,
            constructed to house the Imperial Diet (German: Reichstag), of the
            German Empire. It was opened in 1894 and housed the Diet until 1933,
            when it was severely damaged after being set on fire. After World
            War II, the building fell into disuse; the parliament of the German
            Democratic Republic (the Volkskammer) met in the Palast der Republik
            in East Berlin, while the parliament of the Federal Republic of
            Germany (the Bundestag) met in the Bundeshaus in Bonn.

            Checkpoint Charlie was the name given by the Western Allies to the
            best-known Berlin Wall crossing point between East Berlin and West
            Berlin during the Cold War (1947–1991). It is located in the
            Friedrichstadt neighborhood and was a symbol of the Cold War,
            representing the separation of East and West. The name "Checkpoint
            Charlie" came from the letter C in the NATO phonetic alphabet.

            Alexanderplatz is a large public square and transport hub in the
            central Mitte district of Berlin. The square is named after the
            Russian Tsar Alexander I and is often referred to simply as Alex,
            which also denotes the larger neighbourhood stretching from
            Mollstraße in the northeast to Spandauer Straße and the Rotes
            Rathaus in the southwest.

            Berlin Cathedral is the short name for the Evangelical Supreme
            Parish and Collegiate Church in Berlin, Germany. It is located on
            Museum Island in the Mitte borough. The current building was
            finished in 1905 and is a main work of Historicist architecture of
            the "Kaiserzeit". The Berlin Cathedral has never been a cathedral in
            the actual sense of that term since it has never been the seat of a
            bishop.
