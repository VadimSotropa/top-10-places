            Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament, also known as the Palace of Westminster, are one of the most iconic landmarks in London and a symbol of British democracy and history. The clock tower, Big Ben, is one of the most famous clocks in the world and the bell inside, known as Big Ben, is a famous symbol of London. But did you know that these landmarks have some interesting facts that you might not have heard before?

              <br />
              <li>
                The Houses of Parliament were nearly destroyed in a fire in 1834, and were rebuilt in the Gothic Revival style that we see today.

            St. Paul's Cathedral is one of London's most iconic landmarks and a symbol of the city's rich history and cultural heritage. The grand baroque cathedral, designed by Sir Christopher Wren, has stood tall over the city for over 300 years and is a must-see destination for any visitor. But did you know that the St. Paul's Cathedral has some interesting facts that you might not have heard before?

            <br />
            <ul>
              <li>
                The cathedral is the second-largest in the UK after Liverpool Cathedral.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                The cathedral's dome is the second-largest brick dome in the world after St. Peter's Basilica in Rome.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                The cathedral was used as a navigation point for pilots during WWII as it was one of the few buildings in London with a dome visible from the air.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                The cathedral's Whispering Gallery is called so because sound travels around the dome in a unique way, allowing people to whisper in one corner and be heard clearly in the opposite corner.
