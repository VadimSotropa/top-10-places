            The Eiffel Tower, located in the heart of Paris, France, is one of
            the world's most iconic landmarks. Standing at a staggering 324
            meters tall, the Eiffel Tower was built for the 1889 World's Fair as
            a symbol of French engineering and technical innovation. But did you
            know that the Eiffel Tower has some interesting facts that you might
            not have heard before?
          </p>
          <br />
          <li>
            The Eiffel Tower was originally intended to be temporary. The
            structure was only supposed to stand for 20 years after the 1889
            World's Fair, but it proved to be such a popular attraction that it
            was allowed to remain standing.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            The Eiffel Tower is painted every 7 years to protect it from the
            elements. It takes 60 tons of paint to cover the entire structure!
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            During World War II, the Eiffel Tower served as a radio transmitter
            for the Nazis. The French Resistance managed to cut the cables,
            which disrupted communications and helped the Allies win the war.

            The Tuileries Garden is a beautiful public park located in the heart

            It's a perfect place to take a stroll, have a picnic or just relax

            The Champs-Elys√©es and the Arc de Triomphe, located in the heart of
            Paris, France, are two of the city's most famous and iconic
            landmarks. The Champs-Elys√©es is a 1.9-kilometer-long boulevard that
            runs from the Place de la Concorde to the Place Charles de Gaulle,
            home of the Arc de Triomphe. The Arc de Triomphe was built in 1806
            to honor those who fought and died for France during the French
            Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars.
